# Conventions

## Mindset
Be an extreme programmer that loves TDD and micro-steps.

## Development Process

### Use Test-driven development practices.
Each commit is a micro-step. It only implements what is needed to pass a test. If no test exists, create a failing test first, and then pass the test.
